    <h3>introduction</h3>
      Amethyst is tool for parsing strings and much more.
    <h3>Hello World</h3>
			Create file hello.ame with following example
and use it from ruby by calling Amethyst::load('hello')
<pre> <code>#amethyst file can be viewed as ruby file with ame{pattern} and ame Class{rules} expanded
h=ame{ 'Hello World' } # 'str' matches exactly string str
puts "Hello too" if h.match(gets)

ame Goodbye { #We create class Goodbye
	goodbye = bye _ galaxy # _ matches exactly one whitespace
	
	bye     = 'Goodbye'    # rules are separated by newline
	galaxy  = 'Galaxy'
}
puts "goodbye" if Goodbye.matchwith(:goodbye,gets)

puts "enter two numbers"
ame{ number:a number:b }.match(gets) #ame{pattern} acts as closure so we can bind local variables there
puts "sum is #{a+b}"

puts "Say goodbye"
ame{ Goodbye:bye }.match(gets) # You can match rules from another grammar with Grammar:rule syntax

ame Amethyst{ #You can extend amethyst grammar from which all grammars inherit
	#-&gt; statement uses ruby statement as result
	sum = number:a '+' sum:b -&gt; a+b
			| empty -gt; 0
}
puts "enter numbers separated by +"
puts ame{ sum }.match(gets)
</code></pre>
<h3>Amethyst extends regular expressions </h3>

<ul>
<pre><li>  name           # matches result of rule with name name.
<li>  (expression)   # matches amethyst expression. Usefull for precedence
<li>  {statement}    # execute ruby statement
<li>  -&gt; statement end of line # shortcut for {statement}
<li>  'string'       # matches exactly string
<li>  "string"       # matches string that can be preceeded by whitespaces(by default and <a href="#token">can be redefined</a>)
<li>  &lt;range&gt;        # matches characters in range as [range] in ruby regular expression</pre>
</ul>
Meaning of rule can be changed with following modifiers
<ul>
<pre><li> rule? , rule* , rule+  # repetition - greedily match rule with ? 0-1 times ,with * 0 or more times and with + 1 or more times
<li> ~rule                  # negative lookahead - succeeds iff rule fails consuming no input
<li> &amp;rule                  # lookahead -succeeds iff rule succeeds consuming no input
<li> &amp;{statement}           # special case of lookahead which succeeds iff ruby statement is true</pre>
</ul>
Amethyst expresions can be composed from rules in following ways
<ul>
<pre><li> expr1 | expr2 ... # Priorized choice - Try match with in order expr1,expr2... until we can match rest of input with this choice.
<li> rule1 rule2 ...   # Composion - match rule1 and then match rule2 on text after text consumed by rule1 and so on</pre>
</ul>
We show example amethyst expressions
<code><pre>
  &lt;aA&gt; 'hoy'  #matches ahoy and Ahoy
  &lt;aA&gt; "hoy"  #watch out as this matches also A   hoy
  ("hello" | "goodbye") ("world" | "galaxy")?      #also watch out this as it matches also helloworld
  ("hello" | "goodbye") ( _ ("world" | "galaxy"))? #for example we can use buildin rule space to match one whitespace.
  ("yes" | "no")+ # matches for example yes yes yes  no yes no yes no yesyes
  '"' &lt;^"&gt;* '"'   # matches double-quoted string
</pre></code>
<h3> result of rule</h3>
Each amethyst expression returns its result. Results are obtaned in way similar to ruby. Result of:
<ul>
<pre><li> application of rule is result of body of rule
<li> rule1 rule2    is result of rule2.
<li> expr1 | expr2  is result of expression which succeed.
<li> { statement}   is result of corresponding ruby statement.
<li> rule+ , rule*  is array of results of rule applications
<li> rule?          is result of rule or nil if it wasnt matched
<li> "string",'string',&lt;range&gt; is matched string.
<li> ~rule , &amp;rule is result of rule</pre>
</ul>
<h3> binding  </h3>
 To make results usefull we bind them to variables
 <ul>
 <pre>
<li> rule 
    If subrule occurs at most once in rule we bind its result to variable with name of subrule. 
		If it occurs more times we collect result in array subrules. Also we define shortcuts subrule1,...,subrule9
<li> rule:variable 
    We bind result of rule to corresponding local variable 
 <li> rule:variable.key
    If variable has method key= we use variable.key=result . Otherwise we try to assign result by variable[:key]=result .
    We can chain keys by rule:variable.key1.key2
 <li>rule:{statement} 
		We assign result of rule to local variable it and you can manipulate it in ruby statement.</pre>
 </ul>
 We can use :binding as shortcut for anything:binding<br>


    <h4> append operator</h4>
    We use syntax rule:binding[]. This operator takes result of rule and appends it to binding. 
		It appends it in following way
		<ul>
			<li>  If variable was string it converts result to string and conceates these strings.
			<li>  If variable was array and result was array then it conceates these arrays.
			<li>  If variable was array and result was not array then it appends result to array.
		</ul>
      At begining of rule variable is automaticaly initalized as empty array
 Here are examples
 <code><pre> ( "dog" | "cat" |"horse"):animal " " ("barks" |"meows):voice {animal+" "+voice} #return for example cat barks
 &lt;aA&gt;:s[] 'hoy':s[] # returns ['a','hoy'] or ['A','hoy']
 &lt;aA&gt;:s  'hoy':s[] # returns 'ahoy' or 'Ahoy'
 {""}:s &lt;aA&gt;*:s[] 'hoy':s[] # return for example 'aAaAahoy'
 conv = &lt;a-z&gt;+:{x=it*""} ( " " &lt;a-z&gt;+:{it*""})*:{x+","+it*","} # convert space separated list of words to comma separated list
 word =  &lt;a-z&gt;+:{it*""} # previous example can be simplified as
 conv = word:x (" " word)*:{x+","+it*","}</pre></code>
    <h3>Returning objects</h3>
		It is common that in parsing we construct some tree of objects. Most elegant way is use @Class<br>
		This creates new object of given class and sets local variables bound in rule to instance variables of created object.<br>
		As example we can parse binary trees with rule<br>
<code><pre>makeclasses(Object,[:tree,:value,:left,:right]) #creates class Tree which inherits from object and defines accessors
ame Tre{  
  tree = "(" number:value tree?:left tree?:right ")" @Tree
}</pre></code><br>
<h3> backtracking and persistence</h3>
We use semi-persistence library. Imagine we log all changes of variables and object and if we fail to match we undo corresponding changes.
As example if we match [1,2] with
<code>anything:x[] ( anything:x[] &amp;{false} | anything:y)</code><br>
Array x will contain 1, then 1 and 2, then we fail and revert x back to 1 and then we set y to 2.
<h3></h3>
    <h3> Parsing objects </h3>
			[ rules ]
        Enter object and parse there
        You can use Class[ rules ] which in addition checks if entered object had class Class
      @method=&gt;rule
        take result of method called on entered object and match it by rule
      anything,. matches any object
			number matches number
    <h3>parametrized rules</h3>  
      Rules can take parameters. Syntax is
      rule(pattern) = body
      Where pattern and body are amethyst expressions. You can match multiple patterns by
      rule(pattern1) = body1
          (pattern2) = body2
      You can use parametrized rule by rule(args) syntax.
      args can use any ruby expresion with following conversions
      `expr` is converted to proc that matches amethyst expression expr
			@method is converted to call of method on entered object
			Examples 
			<code><pre>times( :n :r ) = -&lt; n.times{r.call }        #this is parametrized rule which takes n and r as arguments
			bye = times(3, `"cya" | "bye"`)          #we call rule here. `rules` in rule call returns proc whose call matches rules.
			token( :s ) = ' ' seq(s)                    #we redefine token rule so now "text" matches text preceded by exactly one space.</pre></code>

		<h3>Grammars are objective</h3>
			Amethyst grammars support inherance with syntax similar to ruby
			amethyst Grammar &lt; Parent
			super(args)
				matches by same rule in parent grammar
			Grammar::rule(args)
				Matches by rule rule from grammar Grammar
		<h3>read standard prologue</h3>
			Amethyst defines handy rules at standard prologue
			This is its context
		<h3>code completition and error handling</h3>
Code completition and error handling are similar concepts. In error handling we try to discover why we didn't consume more of text.<br>
Also syntax is almost same. We specify rules with error/completition handling as
<table><tr><td>
<pre>completition Grammar {
	rules
}</pre>
<td><pre>error Grammar{
	rules
}
}</pre></table>
When completition/error occurs in rule we handle it by 
<table><tr><td>
rule:part{block}
<td>rule:error{block}
<table>

<h3>standards</h3> 
Different people have different tastes and it is naive to think that language won't evolve. Moreover one of programmer favourite activities are formatting wars.
We try to solve this problem by standard support. We can mix all versions of amethyst as long as underlying AST wont change.<br>
To support standard write as first line<br>
#standard version,format<br>
where version is amethyst version and format are formating rules you want to use.<br>

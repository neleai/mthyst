optimizer simplifying =>[ ] to []

make AmethystModule +include to mimic ruby module
parser to produce literal tree and convert to abstract tree
make position handling explicit as in amethyst/position.ame

generic parent(Class) in tree traversal

variable cget,cset,rbget,rbset or some other generalization
consider pseudovariables

bind cut,stop to corresponding many,or
Add id of cut stop to many/or

code motion of acts and binds

unify lambda+rule in ctranslator2
rewrite using backtracking,repeat until...
continuation passing style

switch and predication by constant propagation?

consider left factor when conditions are in inclusion.

optimalization of lookaheads such that in anything* ~anything the ~anything is automaticaly satisfied(aka eof)
in ~space space* the  space* must be empty (predication to fail)
Do it by constant propagation?

Automaticaly rewrite .* foo to _find(`foo`) and optimalizations
Special case _find(`eof`) consumes everything

adaptive dataflow
think about suitable decomposition

dataflow cantfail, noresult
as constant propagation

saner handling of Locals

predication by splitting to predicated and notpredicated part

serialization
incremental compilation

support for provable refactorization and migrations

functor for case insensivity

, in Acts

copy propagation, expression variables
Constant propagation also do value numbering to register renaming scheme.

analysis what closures can be saved on stack

replace({"a"=>"b","c"=>"d"})

dataflows to calculate bitmasks and test by (chars|both =ones|both) where ones are bits that must be 1 and both bits than can be 0 or 1

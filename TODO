implicit variables
persistence
optimizer simplifying =>[ ] to []
split to separate parser and traverser 
split to traverser and modifier and dataflow_analyzer
make AmethystModule +include to mimic ruby module
make position handling explicit as in amethyst/position.ame
make eof in Pass explicit
refactor args
generic parent(Class) in tree traversal

variable cget,cset,rbget,rbset or some other generalization
consider pseudovariables

work in 1.9.1
unify lambda+rule in ctranslator2
bind cut,stop to corresponding many,or
code motion of acts

optimalization of lookaheads such that in anything* ~anything the ~anything is automaticaly satisfied(aka eof)
in ~space space* the  space* must be empty 
Do it by constant propagation?

detect acts as pure if they have simple form
documentation
rewrite using backtracking,repeat until...

initialize parse by Pass

switch and predication by constant propagation

treat super like renamed rule

dont duplicate rules that dont refer to overwritten rule

saner handling of Locals

generic equality

hashes with different equalization

iterative dataflow

delete choices after fail

in classwitch detect hierarchy

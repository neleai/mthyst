implicit variables
persistence
optimizer simplifying =>[ ] to []
split to separate parser and traverser 
split to traverser and modifier and dataflow_analyzer
make AmethystModule +include to mimic ruby module
parser to produce literal tree and convert to abstract tree
make position handling explicit as in amethyst/position.ame

generic parent(Class) in tree traversal

variable cget,cset,rbget,rbset or some other generalization
consider pseudovariables

work in 1.9.1
unify lambda+rule in ctranslator2
bind cut,stop to corresponding many,or
code motion of acts

documentation

rewrite using backtracking,repeat until...

initialize parse by Pass

switch and predication by constant propagation

consider left factor when conditions are in inclusion.
left factor and binding

optimalization of lookaheads such that in anything* ~anything the ~anything is automaticaly satisfied(aka eof)
in ~space space* the  space* must be empty 
Do it by constant propagation?
delete choices after fail

dont duplicate rules that dont refer to overwritten rule

hashes with different equalization

adaptive dataflow
think about suitable decomposition

Left factor to recognize binds as same
Bind in postfix form

merge detect_switch and detect_classswitch

do not remove unused arguments

dataflow cantfail, noresult

make bind pure
saner handling of Locals

detects also rules in parent that call but are not called

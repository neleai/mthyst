amethyst(mthyst) is ruby top-down parser generator

#For initial bootstrap type
cd lib/c
ruby extconf.rb
make
#which compiles basic methods.
#TODO compile flags are hardcoded. Replace them if you are not in x64

#Then type
cd ../..
./reset
#which recompiles grammars.

#Then feel free to change grammars. To compile your changes type 
ruby bootstrap
#which compiles new grammars by old grammars. Type ruby bootstrap again to compile with new grammars.

#If you break grammars type 
./reset
#Which restores grammars to state they were at current commit.

#For improving speed we look at profile output. You need to install and run oprofile. Run script
compiled/anotate #to get anotated source and assembly after you ran oprofile.

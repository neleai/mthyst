# amethyst(mthyst) is ruby top-down parser generator and tool for pattern matching
# A description can be found at http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~ondra/amethyst/chap2.pdf
# This version of amethyst is not thread safe.

# Currently a supported architecture is x85_64 linux.
 
# For initial build install gcc and ruby version 1.9.
# Then type(on debian, adjust ruby1.9.1 name for other systems):
ruby1.9.1 reset.rb

# Use cases can be found in doc directory.

# If you wish to change amethyst then recompiling is done by
ruby1.9.1 bootstrap
# If your grammar does not compile run reset.rb to restore to state at last commit

# For improving speed we look at profile output. You need to install and run oprofile. Run script
compiled/anotate #to get anotated source and assembly after you ran oprofile.

# If you have uncrustify installed generated c files will be formatted with astyle according to uncrustify.cfg file.

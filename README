amethyst(mthyst) is ruby top-down parser generator and tool for pattern matching
A description can be found at http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~ondra/amethyst/chap2.pdf

# Currently compiling is bit ad-hoc
# We currently support only ruby1.9
# you may need to change settings file to specify what ruby you compile with
# changing to command what extconf uses should work.
 
#For initial build type
ruby1.9.1 reset.rb

#a use cases can be found in doc directory.

#If you wish to change amethyst then recompiling is done by
ruby1.9.1 bootstrap
#if your grammar does not compile run reset.rb to restore to state at last commit

#For improving speed we look at profile output. You need to install and run oprofile. Run script
compiled/anotate #to get anotated source and assembly after you ran oprofile.

#When you have astyle installed generated c files will be formatted with it
